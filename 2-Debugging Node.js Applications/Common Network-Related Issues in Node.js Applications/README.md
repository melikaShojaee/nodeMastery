## Connection Timeouts

Connection timeouts occur when network connections fail to establish within a specified time. This can happen when connecting to external services or databases. Properly handling connection timeouts is essential to prevent long delays and hanging requests in your application.

## DNS Resolution Failures

DNS resolution failures can prevent your application from resolving domain names to IP addresses. This can lead to connection failures or delays when making network requests. Understanding how to handle DNS resolution issues and implementing appropriate retry mechanisms can help mitigate these problems.


## Proxy Configuration Issues

If your application relies on a proxy server for outbound network requests, misconfiguration or compatibility issues with the proxy can cause connectivity problems. Understanding how to configure and troubleshoot proxy settings is crucial for successful network communication in your application.

## SSL/TLS Certificate Validation Errors

SSL/TLS certificate validation errors can occur when making HTTPS requests. These errors can be caused by expired, self-signed, or untrusted certificates. Properly configuring certificate validation and handling certificate-related errors is essential for secure and reliable network communication.

## Firewall or Network Security Restrictions

Firewalls or network security policies may block certain network ports or protocols required by your application. This can prevent network communication and lead to connection failures. Understanding network security restrictions and working with network administrators to configure appropriate rules is important for seamless network operation.

## Load Balancer Configuration Problems

If your application is deployed behind a load balancer, misconfiguration of the load balancer can cause network issues. This can include incorrect routing, failure to distribute the load evenly, or improper handling of session persistence. Understanding load balancer configuration and working closely with DevOps teams can help resolve these issues.

## Proxy Server or API Rate Limiting

When interacting with external APIs or proxy servers, hitting rate limits imposed by those services can result in temporary connection failures or limited functionality. Understanding rate limiting mechanisms, implementing appropriate rate limiting strategies in your application, and handling rate limit-related errors is important for smooth API integration.

## Network Interruptions

Unstable network connections, such as intermittent Wi-Fi or mobile network disruptions, can lead to temporary network outages or connection drops. Implementing retry mechanisms, handling connection interruptions gracefully, and providing appropriate feedback to users can enhance the resilience of your application in the face of network interruptions.
