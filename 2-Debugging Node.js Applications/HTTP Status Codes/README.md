## Introduction

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It uses a simple and widely adopted system of status codes to indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. These status codes are three-digit numbers that provide information about the response from a server.

Understanding HTTP status codes is crucial for web developers, system administrators, and anyone dealing with web services. This README aims to provide a comprehensive guide to these status codes.

## HTTP Status Code Categories

HTTP status codes are grouped into the following five categories:

- **1xx Informational**: These status codes indicate provisional responses, acknowledging that the request was received.

- **2xx Success**: These codes indicate that the request was successful or accepted.

- **3xx Redirection**: These codes inform the client that further action is needed to complete the request.

- **4xx Client Errors**: These codes represent errors made by the client (e.g., invalid request, unauthorized access).

- **5xx Server Errors**: These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

## List of Common HTTP Status Codes

### 1xx Informational

- **100 Continue**: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.

- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching protocols in response to the client's request.

### 2xx Success

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server has fulfilled it.

- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.

- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no need to return a response body.

- **206 Partial Content**: The server is delivering only a part of the resource due to a range request.

### 3xx Redirection

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.

- **302 Found (or 303 See Other)**: The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.

- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the specified date, and the client can use its cached copy.

### 4xx Client Errors

- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed, and the server won't process it.

- **401 Unauthorized**: The request lacks proper authentication credentials.

- **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to fulfill it.

- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

### 5xx Server Errors

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message, indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition.

- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server.

- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request.

- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.
